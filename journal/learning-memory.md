# Learning Memory - Agno Journey

## üß† Concept-Based Knowledge Base

This file captures insights, feedback, and learnings organized by concepts rather than chronological order. It serves as a growing knowledge base that AI can reference when helping with similar problems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools

### Ollama Integration

- **Setup:** Container-based Ollama service with 8GB memory limit
- **Configuration:** 4 threads, 1 loaded model for optimal performance
- **Health Checks:** Every 30s with automatic restart policy
- **Key Insight:** Local LLM setup eliminates API costs and enables unlimited experimentation
- **Connection:** Use `host="http://ollama:11434"` for devcontainer setup
- **Model Loading:** `llama3.2:3b` model successfully loaded and tested

### Embedding Models & Local Infrastructure

- **Local Embedding Models:** Successfully integrated nomic-embed-text (~1.5GB) via Ollama
- **Top 3 Ollama Embedding Models:** nomic-embed-text (best), snowflake-arctic-embed2 (multilingual), snowflake-arctic-embed (English)
- **Key Insight:** Local embeddings provide complete control, zero costs, and no network latency
- **Integration:** Agno supports OllamaEmbedder for local embedding generation
- **Challenge:** Vector database compatibility issues with LanceDB versions
- **Learning:** AI delegation excellent for research, poor for technical debugging

### Vector Databases & Agno Abstractions

- **Agno Abstraction Layer:** Complete abstraction for vector database operations
- **LanceDB Integration:** Simple, clean integration through Agno's abstraction layer
- **Key Insight:** No need to understand underlying vector DB mechanics for experimentation
- **DevEX Excellence:** Agno team built abstractions that enable rapid prototyping
- **Learning Efficiency:** Focus on concepts rather than implementation details
- **Production Readiness:** Can dive deeper into specific components when needed

### Development Environment

- **Container Architecture:** Docker Compose with Python devcontainer
- **Ports:** 8888 (Jupyter), 8000 (Dev Server), 11434 (Ollama)
- **Extensions:** Python, Jupyter, debugging, formatting tools
- **Key Insight:** Isolated environment prevents conflicts and ensures reproducibility
- **Python Setup:** Virtual environments with `uv` for modern package management
- **Dependencies:** `agno`, `ollama`, `yfinance` successfully installed and tested

### Python Package Management

- **Current State:** Running individual files, not building complete systems
- **Package Management:** Using `uv` for immediate package installation
- **Learning Gap:** Need deeper understanding of Python package management
- **Future Need:** Will require proper dependency management for production systems
- **Key Learning:** Different approaches for experimentation vs deployment
