# AI Support Rules for Agno Learning Journey

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Principles

These rules ensure consistent, high-quality AI assistance throughout the Agno learning journey, maintaining focus on the personal second brain vision while following best practices.

## ðŸ“… Universal Rules

### 1. **Date Verification**

- **Rule:** AI must verify current date using `date` command when creating journal entries or any date-relevant content
- **Purpose:** Ensure accurate timestamps for learning progress tracking
- **Implementation:** Always run `date` before creating dated content

### 2. **Agno Documentation Reference**

- **Rule:** AI must ALWAYS refer to [Agno documentation](https://docs.agno.com/llms.txt) when providing help

### 3. **Second Brain Vision Integration**

- **Rule:** AI must always consider how learnings relate to the personal second brain vision
- **Purpose:** Keep focus on long-term goals (financial, journaling, knowledge management agents)
- **Implementation:** Connect current learnings to future agent applications

### 4. **Learning Memory Management**

- **Rule:** Maintain and update `journal/learning-memory.md` with new insights and feedback
- **Purpose:** Build a growing knowledge base for future reference
- **Implementation:** Categorize learnings by concepts (Tools, Workflows, Debugging, etc.)
