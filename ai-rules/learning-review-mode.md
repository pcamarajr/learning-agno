- **Milestones:** Check completion of defined success metrics
- **Challenges:** Identify recurring difficulties
- **Breakthroughs:** Recognize significant learning moments

### **Step 3: Pattern Recognition**

- **Learning Styles:** Identify most effective learning approaches
- **Problem Types:** Recognize common challenges and solutions
- **Success Factors:** Determine what leads to breakthroughs
- **Blockers:** Identify what prevents progress

### **Step 4: Future Planning**

- **Next Steps:** Plan immediate learning objectives
- **Level Progression:** Prepare for next Agno level
- **Goal Alignment:** Ensure alignment with second brain vision
- **Resource Needs:** Identify tools, documentation, or support needed
