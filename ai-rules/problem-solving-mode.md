# Problem-Solving Mode Rules

## üéØ Purpose

Provide systematic debugging and issue resolution when user is stuck or frustrated.

## üìù Core Rules

### **Systematic Approach**

- **Rule:** Follow a structured problem-solving methodology
- **Implementation:** Break down ‚Üí Debug ‚Üí Multiple approaches

### **Problem Breakdown**

- **Rule:** Divide complex problems into smaller, manageable components
- **Implementation:** Identify root cause, isolate variables, test incrementally

### **Systematic Debugging**

- **Rule:** Debug in order: Environment ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Configuration
- **Implementation:** Check each layer systematically before moving to next

### **Multiple Approaches**

- **Rule:** Provide alternative solutions and approaches
- **Implementation:** Offer different strategies, tools, or methodologies

## üîß Debugging Framework

### **Step 1: Problem Analysis**

- **Identify:** What exactly is the problem?
- **Context:** When does it occur?
- **Impact:** What's preventing progress?
- **Attempts:** What has been tried already?

### **Step 2: Environment Check**

- **Container Status:** Are all services running?
- **Resource Usage:** Memory, CPU, disk space
- **Network:** Port availability, connectivity
- **Dependencies:** Package versions, configurations

### **Step 3: Code Analysis**

- **Syntax:** Check for basic errors
- **Logic:** Review code flow and logic
- **Dependencies:** Verify imports and requirements
- **Documentation:** Check against official examples

### **Step 4: Configuration Review**

- **Settings:** Environment variables, config files
- **Permissions:** File access, user rights
- **Integration:** Service connections, API endpoints
- **Versioning:** Compatibility between components

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Problem Categories

### **Environment Issues**

- **Container Problems:** Service not starting, resource limits
- **Network Issues:** Port conflicts, connectivity problems
- **Dependency Issues:** Missing packages, version conflicts
- **Permission Issues:** File access, user rights

### **Code Issues**

- **Syntax Errors:** Basic programming mistakes
- **Logic Errors:** Incorrect implementation
- **API Issues:** Wrong endpoints, authentication problems
- **Integration Issues:** Service communication problems

### **Configuration Issues**

- **Environment Variables:** Missing or incorrect values
- **Service Configuration:** Wrong settings, missing files
- **Network Configuration:** Port mappings, firewall issues
- **Security Issues:** Authentication, authorization problems

```

## üéØ Quality Standards

### **Problem Analysis**

- **Clarity:** Clearly understand the problem before attempting solutions
- **Context:** Gather sufficient information about the environment and situation
- **History:** Understand what has been tried already
- **Impact:** Assess the urgency and scope of the problem

### **Solution Approach**

- **Systematic:** Follow structured debugging methodology
- **Incremental:** Test changes one at a time
- **Documented:** Record all attempts and results
- **Alternative:** Provide multiple solution approaches

### **Resolution Quality**

- **Complete:** Ensure the problem is fully resolved
- **Understood:** Identify and document the root cause
- **Preventive:** Suggest ways to avoid similar issues
- **Educational:** Extract learning value from the experience

## üîÑ Integration Rules

### **With Learning Memory**

- **Update:** Add new debugging insights to appropriate categories
- **Reference:** Check for similar problems in learning memory
- **Pattern:** Identify recurring problem types and solutions
- **Prevention:** Document preventive measures for future

### **With Documentation**

- **Journal Entry:** Create detailed problem-solving journal entry
- **Troubleshooting Guide:** Update environment-specific guides
- **Pattern Library:** Document useful debugging patterns
- **Knowledge Base:** Add to concept-based learning memory
