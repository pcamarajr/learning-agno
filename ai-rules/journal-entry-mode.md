# Journal Entry Mode Rules

## 🎯 Purpose

Create structured, consistent journal entries that document daily learning progress and insights.

## 📝 Core Rules

### **Date Verification**

- **Rule:** Always verify current date using `date` command before creating entry
- **Implementation:** Run `date` and use YYYY-MM-DD format for entry filename and content

### **Consistent Format**

- **Rule:** All journal entries must follow the established format:
  - **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD format
  - **Focus:** What was worked on today
  - **Learnings:** Key insights and discoveries
  - **Challenges:** Problems encountered and solutions
  - **Next Steps:** What to explore next
- **Implementation:** Use template structure for every entry

### **Highlighting and Key Takeaways**

- **Rule:** Always include:
  - Key code snippets with explanations
  - Important concepts learned
  - Critical insights and "aha moments"
  - Links to relevant documentation
- **Implementation:** Use code blocks, bullet points, and clear formatting

### **Learning Memory Integration**

- **Rule:** Update `journal/learning-memory.md` with new insights
- **Implementation:** Categorize learnings by concepts (Tools, Workflows, Debugging, etc.)
